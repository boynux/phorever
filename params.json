For example, a simple `phorever start scheduler` will ensure all background processes required for a scheduler server are running.\r\n\r\n## Project Status\r\n\r\nThe project is currently in an MVP state after some exploratory coding. Currently it launches processes based on requested role and respawns processes after a resurrection wait time.\r\n\r\n**Currently *not* supported, but desperately needed before BETA1:**\r\n\r\n* Redirecting logs\r\n* Processes that daemonize themselves (cannot check custom PIDs)\r\n* Giving up after certain thresholds\r\n* Notification on aberrant behavior\r\n\r\n**Features to come:**\r\n\r\n* Configure respawn and notification behavior\r\n* Hooks for your own custom event listener classes for more fine-grained control\r\n* Status monitor and statistical logs"}
